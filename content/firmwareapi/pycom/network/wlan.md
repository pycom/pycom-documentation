This class provides a driver for the WiFi network processor in the module. Example usage:

```python
import network
import time
# setup as a station
wlan = network.WLAN(mode=network.WLAN.STA)
wlan.connect('your-ssid', auth=(network.WLAN.WPA2, 'your-key'))
while not wlan.isconnected():
    time.sleep_ms(50)
print(wlan.ifconfig())

# now use socket as usual
```

## Quick Usage Example

```python
import machine
from network import WLAN

# configure the WLAN subsystem in station mode (the default is AP)
wlan = WLAN(mode=WLAN.STA)
# go for fixed IP settings (IP, Subnet, Gateway, DNS)
wlan.ifconfig(config=('192.168.0.107', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.1', '192.168.0.1'))
wlan.scan()     # scan for available networks
wlan.connect(ssid='mynetwork', auth=(WLAN.WPA2, 'my_network_key'))
while not wlan.isconnected():
    pass
print(wlan.ifconfig())
```

## Constructors

### class network.WLAN([id=0], ...)

Create a WLAN object, and optionally configure it. See init for params of configuration.

> The WLAN constructor is special in the sense that if no arguments are given, it will return the already existing WLAN instance without re-configuring it. This is because WLAN is a system feature of the WiPy. If the already existing instance is not initialised it will do the same as the other constructors an will initialise it with default values.

## Methods

#### wlan.init(mode, [ssid=None, auth=None, channel=1, antenna=WLAN.MAN_ANT, power_save=False, hidden=False, bandwidth=WLAN.HT40, max_tx_pwr, country=NA, protocol=(1,1,1)])

Set or get the WiFi network processor configuration.

Arguments are:

* `mode`: can be either:
  * `WLAN.STA`: Station mode, connect to a WiFinetwork
  * `WLAN.AP`: Access Point mode, create a WiFi network. You _must_ specify the `ssid`
  * `WLAN.STA_AP`: Both Station and Access Point mode are active. 
* `ssid`: a string with the SSID name.
* `auth`: a tuple with `(sec, key)`. Security can be one of the following. The key is a string with the network password.
  * `None`: 
  * `WLAN.WEP`: Using this in `WLAN.AP`, the key must be a string of hexadecimal values.
  * `WLAN.WPA`
  * `WLAN.WPA2`
  * `WLAN.WPA2_ENT`: this will use the following format: `(sec, username, password)`
* `channel`: a number in the range 1-11. Only needed when mode is `WLAN.AP`.
* `antenna`: select between the internal and the external antenna. With our development boards it defaults to using the on-board antenna. Value can be either:
  * `WLAN.INT_ANT`: The on-board antenna
  * `WLAN.EXT_ANT`: The U.FL connector (external antenna)
  * `WLAN.MAN_ANT`: Manually select the state of the antenna switch on `P12`. By default, this will select the on-board antenna
* `power_save` enables or disables power save functions in `WLAN.STA` mode.
* `hidden`: create a hidden SSID when set to `True`. only valid in `WLAN.AP` mode.
* `bandwidth` is the Bandwidth to use, either:
  * `WLAN.HT20`: 20MHz
  * `WLAN.HT40`: 40MHz
* `max_tx_pwr` is the maximum WiFi TX power allowed. see `WLAN.max_tx_power()` for more details
* `country` tuple representing the country configuration parameters. see `WLAN.country()` for more details
* `protocol` tuple representing the protocol. see `WLAN.wifi_protocol()` for more details


### wlan.deinit()

Disables the WiFi radio.

### wlan.connect(ssid, [auth=None, bssid=None, timeout=None, ca_certs=None, keyfile=None, certfile=None, identity=None, hostname=None])

Connect to a WiFi Access Point using the given SSID, and other parameters

* `ssid`: a string with the SSID name.
* `auth`: a tuple with `(sec, key)`. Security can be one of the following. The key is a string with the network password.
  * `None`: 
  * `WLAN.WEP`: Using this in `WLAN.AP`, the key must be a string of hexadecimal values.
  * `WLAN.WPA`
  * `WLAN.WPA2`
  * `WLAN.WPA2_ENT`: this will use the following format: `(sec, username, password)`
* `bssid` is the MAC address of the AP to connect to. This is useful when there are several APs with the same SSID.
* `timeout` is the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to succeed.
* `ca_certs` is the path to the CA certificate. This argument is not mandatory.
* `keyfile` is the path to the client key. Only used if `username` and `password` are not part of the `auth` tuple.
* `certfile` is the path to the client certificate. Only used if `username` and `password` are not part of the `auth` tuple.
* `identity` is only used in case of `WLAN.WPA2_ENT` security. Needed by the server.
* `hostname` is the name of the host connecting to the AP. Max length of name string is 32 Bytes

> The ESP32 only handles certificates with `pkcs8` format (but not the "Traditional SSLeay RSAPrivateKey" format). The private key should be RSA coded with 2048 bits at maximum.


### wlan.scan([ssid=None, bssid=None, channel=0, show_hidden=False, type=WLAN.SCAN_ACTIVE, scantime=120ms])

Performs a network scan and returns a list of named tuples with (ssid, bssid, sec, channel, rssi). When no config args passed scan will be performed with default configurations.

Note: For Fast scan mode ssid/bssid and channel should be

* `ssid`: Scan only for the given ssid
* `bssid`: Scan only for the givenbssid. The bssid is given as 6 Hexadecimal bytes literals (i.e `b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'`)
* `channel`: If set to 0, there will be an all-channel scan; otherwise, there will be a specific-channel scan.
* `show_hidden`: Scan for hidden ssid's as well.
* `type`: The type of scan performed. Values can be 
  * `WLAN.SCAN_ACTIVE`: the scan is will be performed by sending a probe request. 
  * `WLAN.SCAN_PASSIVE`: switches to a specifi channel and waits for beacon
* `scantime` : This field is used to control how long the scan dwells on each channel. For active scans, dwell times for each channel are listed below. For passive scans, this designates the dwell time for each channel. scantime is given as a tuple for min and max times `(min,max)`
  * min=0, max=0: scan dwells on each channel for 120 ms.
  * min>0, max=0: scan dwells on each channel for 120 ms.
  * min=0, max>0: scan dwells on each channel for max ms.
  * min>0, max>0: The minimum time the scan dwells on each channel is min ms. If no AP is found during this time frame, the scan switches to the next channel. Otherwise, the scan dwells on the channel for max ms.If you want to improve the performance of the the scan, you can try to modify these two parameters.

### wlan.disconnect()

Disconnect from the WiFi access point.

### wlan.isconnected()

In case of STA mode, returns `True` if connected to a WiFi access point and has a valid IP address. In AP mode returns `True` when a station is connected, `False` otherwise.

### wlan.ifconfig(id=0, config=['dhcp' or configtuple])

When `id` is 0, the configuration will be get/set on the Station interface. When `id` is 1 the configuration will be done for the AP interface.

Get or set the interface configuration. 

Optionally specify the configuration parameter:

* `config='dhcp'`: If 'dhcp' is passed as a parameter, then the DHCP client is enabled and the IP parameters are negotiated with the DHCP server.
* `config=(ip, nm, gw, dns)`: If the 4-tuple config is given then a static IP is configured. 

For example: `eth.ifconfig(config=('192.168.0.4', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.1', '8.8.8.8'))`.

### wlan.mode([mode])

Get or set the WLAN mode.

### wlan.ssid([ssid])

Get or set the SSID (Set SSID of AP).

In case if mode = `WLAN.STA` this method can get the ssid of AP the board is connected to.

In case of mode = `WLAN.AP` this method can get the ssid of the board's own AP.

In case of mode = `WLAN.STA_AP` this method can get the ssid of board's own AP plus the AP the STA is connected to in form of a tuple:


### wlan.auth([auth])

Get or set the authentication type when in AP mode.

### wlan.channel([channel, secondary_channel=WLAN.SEC_CHN_NONE])

* In AP mode, this will get or set the WiFi channel. The secondary channel has no effect.
* In STA mode, this will get the channel. Setting the channel is only allowed in Promiscuous mode. A secondary channel can be given as well if the bandwidth is set to `WLAN.HT40`, choosing from the following:
  * `WLAN.SEC_CHN_POS_ABOVE`: Choose a secondary channel above the currently selected channel
  * `WLAN.SEC_CHN_POS_BELOW`: Choose a secondary channel below the currently selected channel
  * `WLAN.SEC_CHN_NONE`
Possible channels are in the range of 1-14, depending on your country settings.

### wlan.antenna([antenna])

Get or set the antenna type (external or internal). Value can be:
  * `WLAN.INT_ANT`: The on-board antenna
  * `WLAN.EXT_ANT`: The U.FL connector (external antenna)
  * `WLAN.MAN_ANT`: Manually select the state of the antenna switch on `P12`. By default, this will select the on-board antenna

   With our development boards it defaults to using the internal antenna, but in the case of an OEM module, the antenna pin (`P12`) is not used, so it's free to be used for other things.

### wlan.mac([mac, mode])

### wlan.max_tx_power([power])

Gets or Sets the maximum allowable transmission power for wifi. This is also related to the country setting.

Packets of different rates are transmitted in different powers according to the configuration in phy init data. This API only sets maximum WiFi transmiting power. If this API is called, the transmiting power of every packet will be less than or equal to the value set by this API.

Values passed in the `power` argument are mapped to transmit power level in dBm. Possible values are between 8 and 78, where 8 corresponds to 2dBm and 78 to 20dBm. All values in between increase the maximum output power in 0.25dBm increments. 

### wlan.country([country, schan, nchan, max_tx_pwr, policy])

Gets or sets Country configuration parameters for wifi.
