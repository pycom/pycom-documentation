## What is Pylife?

The Pylife App is our digital dashboard, where you will find all of your PyGo devices and their owners. It has messaging, mapping and visualisation features, all in a bid to connect a community of people.

We have spent years in the technology field developing multi-network solutions. This means that the Pylife app will work with five different types of network. That means that you’re not paying for a device that only works in certain cases.

* Create groups, invite your people add devices;
* Create alerts from templates for your devices, configure them;
* Monitor activity of your devices, receive real-time updates;
* Share your activity with your people through groups;
