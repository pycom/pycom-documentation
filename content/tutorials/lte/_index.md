The following tutorials demonstrate the use of the LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT functionality on cellular enabled Pycom modules.

Our cellular modules support both LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT, these are new lower power, long range, cellular protocols. These are not the same as the full version of 2G/3G/LTE supported by cell phones, and require your local carriers to support them. At the time of writing, CAT-M1 and NB-IoT connectivity is not widely available so be sure to check with local carriers if support is available where you are.
