>Note: Before using the Pysense, Pytrack and Pyscan boards, check the [GitHub](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries) for the latest version of the libraries.

To use the Pysense, Pytrack or Pyscan, make a folder inside your project folder and call it `lib`. Then, copy the appropiate sensor libraries from the github repository to the folder. Always copy the `pysense.py` or `pytrack.py` and `pycoproc.py` files if you want to use the boards' functions. The `pycoproc.py` library also allows for a special sleep mode. An example for this is provided [here](../expansionboards/sleep/)


* [Pygate](../expansionboards/pygate/)
* [Pysense](../expansionboards/pysense/)
* [Pysense 2.0 X](../expansionboards/pysense2/)
* [Pytrack](../expansionboards/pytrack/)
* [Pytrack 2.0 X](../expansionboards/pytrack2/)
* [Pyscan](../expansionboards/pyscan/)


>Note: Make sure to click `upload to device` to be able to `import` the appropriate libraries in your code!
