## Notes

### Power
Do not use the 3.3V pin **in combination with** the Vin pin to supply the device as this will damage the voltage regulator on the board.

### Antenna placement
Always attach the appropriate antenna when using a wireless connection (LoRa / LTE / SigFox). For WiFi / BLE, it is not mandatory to use an external antenna when you did not explicitly specify this in your code.


### AT Commands

The AT commands for the Sequans Monarch modem on the FiPy are available in a [PDF file](/gitbook/assets/Monarch-LR5110-ATCmdRefMan-rev6_noConfidential.pdf).
