The Pysense shield allows you to sense the environment using 5 different sensors:
* Accelerometer (LIS2HH12)
* Light Sensor (LTR329ALS01)
* Pressure Sensor (MPL3115A2)
* Temperature / Humidity Sensor (SI7006A20)

## Getting started
1. Find the libraries for the Pysense in the [Pycom libraries](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/tree/master/shields) repository on Github. 
1. Download the files and extract them into the project folder in Pymakr
1. Click the `upload project to device` button. This will store all necessary files on the device and allow you to import them in the example `main.py`.
1. Check the REPL:
