## Datasheet

The datasheet of the Expansion Board is available as a [PDF File](/gitbook/assets/expansion3-specsheet-1.pdf)

[ROHS certification](/gitbook/assets/RoHs_declarations/RoHS-for-Expansion-Board(8286-00033P)-20190523.pdf)

## Pinout

The pinout of the Expansion Board is available as a [PDF File](/gitbook/assets/expansion3-pinout.pdf)

The expansion board contains 7 jumpers labeled:
- TX: TX UART (GPIO1) communication of the development board to the Expansionboard
- RTS: Can be used for UART flow control. Connected to GPIO7. 
- RX: RX UART (GPIO2() communication of the development board to the Expansionboard
- CTS: Can be used for UART flow control. Connected to GPIO6.
- BAT: Connect the resistor divider on the Expansionboard to the Voltage monitoring ADC Pin (GPIO3)
- LED: Connect the LED on the Expansionboard to GPIO16
- CHG: Removing the jumper will decrease battery charging current from 450mA to 100mA

> Be gentle when plugging and unplugging from the USB connector. Whilst the USB connector is soldered and is relatively strong, if it breaks off it can be very difficult to fix.
## Notes
### Battery Charger
> Make sure you check the polarity of the battery before plugging it in! Connect the positive side to the side marked with a `+`. 

The Expansion Board features a single cell Li-Ion/Li-Po charger with a JST PHRâ€‘2 connector. When the board is being powered via the micro USB connector, the Expansion Board will charge the battery (if connected). When the `CHG` jumper is present, the battery will be charged at `450mA`. If this value is too high for your application, removing the jumper lowers the charge current to `100mA`.

> To use the battery, pull `P8/G15` high (connect to `3v3`). If you want to use the SD card as well, use a 10k pull-up.

### Differences between v2.0 and v3.0

* The FTDI chip as been replaced with a custom programmed PIC, similar to the

  Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan boards. This allows our firmware update tool to

  automatically put the module into bootloader mode.

* Added a "Safe Boot" button to enter more easily into safe boot. This button connects

  `P12` to `3.3v` and if pressed and held while the reset button is pressed on

  a Pycom module, the module will enter safe boot.

## Troubleshooting

* If PIC stays in bootloader mode, the [`dfu-util` update](/updatefirmware/expansionboard/) should be performed

## 3D model for case design
