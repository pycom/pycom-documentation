This full Hotspot is compatible with Helium LongFi™ and Helium Blockchain technology.

Use it to mine [Helium HNT](https://www.helium.com/token) Crypto Coins on the [Helium LoRaWAN Network](https://www.helium.com/lorawan). Helium’s network is referred to as The People's Network. It is powered by an entirely new incentive model - made possible by their Helium Blockchain. 
Installing a LoRa Hotspot means you are rewarded in HNT crypto coins as soon as you have [“Proof-of-Coverage”](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/proof-of-coverage/).
