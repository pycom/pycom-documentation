## General Information about Vodafone Cellular Connectivity Services

### What is NB-IoT?
NB-IoT is a LPWA network type which helps to minimise the power consumption of connected devices, while increasing system capacity and spectral efficiency. This means wider network coverage in areas that wouldn’t necessarily be covered by existing cellular technologies.

Pycom’s GPy, FiPy and G01 supports NB-IoT and Cat-M1 (LTE-M).

### Why is Pycom providing Vodafone NB-IoT SIM Cards?
Over the past few years, Pycom has been in receipt of many a request for access to SIM cards. In many cases, it’s still difficult for the large mobile carriers to provide SIMs in 1s and 2s or even quantities of 10 or 20. With its already low-touch platform and ordering process, Pycom is perfectly positioned to remove the barriers to access and so we have.
