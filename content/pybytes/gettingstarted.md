If you did not get started with our devices yet, please follow [this guide ](/gettingstarted/) first.

## Step 1: Create a Pybytes Account

If you already have a Forum or Webshop account, you can use the same credentials to log into [Pybytes](https://pybytes.pycom.io/)

Else, go to [Pybytes](https://pybytes.pycom.io) and create an account

## Step 2: Create a device 
1. Click on [Add Device](https://pybytes.pycom.io/devices). You can either add a device using USB, or the [Pybytes App](/pybytes/smart/). If you are planning on provisioning a lot of devices, we would definitely recommend using the Pybytes app. In this guide, we will describe the process using USB.

2. Select your device (WiPy, LoPy, SiPy, etc.).

3. Select your network options. This will be how your device connects to both Pybytes and the internet. For now, we will choose WiFi. This will show a subwindow where you enter your WiFi credentials. This will only be used to connect your device with a WiFi network to access pybytes.

4. Choose a unique name for your device and hit `Next` !

5. At the end, Pybytes will show that your device profile was successfully created.

## Step 3: Provision your device

After creation, you will land on the provisioning page. This is where we 'inform' the device about the Pybytes connection and how to set it up. The first time you set up the device for use with Pybytes, you will need to provision it using the Firmware Updater Tool. This is a good moment to become familiar with the tool [here](/updatefirmware/device/).

### Offline provisioning

1. Open the tool, select your board and select the bottom two checkboxes on this page

2. This will ask for a `Pybytes activation token`. Generate a token from pybytes and paste it in the Firmware Updater tool. This will instantly generate a success message in Pybytes.

3. Continue with the firmware update to the device.

### Online provisioning

1. Download the app:
    - Debian - [Installer](https://software.pycom.io/findupgrade?product=pycom-fwupdater-online&type=all&platform=unix&redirect=true). 
      Unzip file and run create-service.sh with root privileges. 
    - MacOS - [Installer](https://software.pycom.io/findupgrade?product=pycom-fwupdater-online&type=all&platform=macos&redirect=true)
    - Windows - [Installer](https://software.pycom.io/findupgrade?product=pycom-fwupdater-online&type=all&platform=win32&redirect=true)
    
    To check if the app is running: 
    - Debian - run ` sudo systemctl status fwupdater` in your terminal. You 
      should see the message that service is active and running.
    - MacOS - Either find `FwUpdater` process in System Monitor list, or run 
      `ps aux | grep FwUpdater` this command should return list of 3 processes.
    - Windows - find `Pycom Online Firmware Update` in Windows Task Manager 
      at Services tab.

   To restart the app:
   - Debian - run ` sudo systemctl restart fwupdater` in your terminal.
   - MacOS - Find `FwUpdater` process in System Monitor list and kill the 
     process, service will restart automatically.
   - Windows - find `Pycom Online Firmware Update` in Windows Task Manager
     at Services tab, do the right click and choose 'Restart' option.

2. Click on `Online Firmware updater` at Provisioning tab on the device page.

3. Click on `Start provisionning`

4. Select the port to which your device is connected. Select your region and 
   country. Select the Firmware type and version.

5. Click next to start provisionning the device.

## Step 4: Your first signal

1. Reset your Pycom device using the reset button. This will reboot the device and activate the Pybytes connection automatically. The output will look similar to this. You should see the `Last Connection` status in Pybytes change from `Never` to `Seconds ago`

    > If you get any kind of error message, check the WiFi credentials you entered are correct and that you are in range of this WiFi network

2. Now, in the REPL, you can type:
    ```python
    >>> pybytes.send_signal(1, "hello world")
    ```
    And it will show up on Pybytes in the `signals` tab:

You can continue to [display data from your device into the Pybytes dashboard](/pybytes/dashboard/)
