The Pybytes app will allow you to quickly provision any number of devices effortlessly to Pybytes. This is especially useful if you are planning to provision multiple devices, as the device type, WiFi network and name get automatically assigned in the Pybytes application, and all you will need to do is power up the devices that need provisioning.

> Your devices will need to run **firmware 1.20.1** or newer.

> Before starting, make sure you have enabled Pybytes smart config on the devices you want to provision by using `pybytes.smart_config(True)`, or by checking the option in the firmware updater tool. New devices will come with pybytes and smart config enabled by default.

## Take into consideration

* If you are using iOS 12, turn off your Wi-Fi completely on your iPhone.
* Only use a Wi-Fi network with 2.4GHz as Pycom devices cannot connect to a 5GHz network.
* Your device might be provisioned faster if you move your device closer to your Wi-Fi router.
* Make sure your devices are powered on and running firmware 1.20.1 or newer.
* You cannot provision the same devices on the different Pybytes account unless you [erased them completely](../../advance/cli/#erase-all) and flashed the latest firmware again with FW updater tool.
* If there is a spinning wheel on your screen, that means that your device is being provisioned. If it has disappeared, then press the START button again.
