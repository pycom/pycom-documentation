## What is Pybytes?

Pybytes is a device management platform that empowers you by giving you full control over your Pycom devices.
With Pybytes you have control over your device's data stream and more:

* Visualise the sensor data according to your interests by using our customisable dashboard;
* Check the status of your entire fleet;
* Track of your assets with our geolocation feature;
* Distribute firmware updates on a scalable approach.

In a nutshell, Pybytes is an environment designed to optimise your IoT applications when using Pycom boards.

## What does Pybytes offer you?

* Data Visualisation: The Pybytes dashboard is customisable, allowing you to freely set up key performance indicators and time series data from all your sensors.
* Intelligent notifications: Keep track of your device's status, battery level, data streaming and measurements with pre-defined alarms.
* Terminal: Execute commands to gather accurate information from your devices using Pybytes terminal shell.
* Firmware updates over the air: Upgrade or downgrade firmware versions with our exclusive firmware update.
* Track your assets position: Google Maps API means you can track your device's geolocation.

> Note: If the [Pybytes website](https://pybytes.pycom.io/) seems to be down for you, do not worry! 
  > * In Chrome, open developer settings using F12, click on the `Application` tab and `Service workers` next to the gear icon. Then, open the menu `service workers from other origins` and click `unregister`. That should solve the problem!
