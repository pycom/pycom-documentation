## Pymesh Monitoring

Once the Pymesh is working is possible to see Pymesh monitoring data on the Pymesh interface.

At Pymesh Structure, is visible the device name, role and Lora Mac.

Pymesh Monitoring shows the devices as a node, the last node's border router, the last connection and the number of neighbors.

If the user clicks on the devices and go to the **Signal** interface, the user can see the data that the node is exchanging on the Pymesh.
