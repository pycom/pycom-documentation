# Pysense API

This chapter describes the various libraries which are designed for the Pysense board. This includes details about the various methods and classes available for each of the Pysenseâ€™s sensors.

### 3-Axis Accelerometer (LIS2HH12)

Pysense has a 3-Axis Accelerometer that provides outputs for acceleration as well as roll, pitch and yaw.

#### Constructors

#####<class><i>class</i> LIS2HH12(pysense = None, sda = 'P22', scl = 'P21')</class>

Creates a `LIS2HH12` object, that will return values for acceleration, roll, pitch and yaw. Constructor must be passed a Pysense or I2C object to successfully construct.

#### Methods
#####<function>LIS2HH12.acceleration()</function>

Read the acceleration from the `LIS2HH12`. Returns a **tuple** with the 3 values of acceleration (G).

#####<function>LIS2HH12.roll()</function>

Read the current roll from the `LIS2HH12`. Returns a **float** in degrees in the range -180 to 180.

#####<function>LIS2HH12.pitch()</function>

Read the current pitch from the `LIS2HH12`. Returns a **float** in degrees in the range -90 to 90. Once the board tilts beyond this range the values will repeat. This is due to a lack of yaw measurement, making it not possible to know the exact orientation of the board.

### Digital Ambient Light Sensor (LTR-329ALS-01)

Pysense has a dual light sensor that provides outputs for external light levels in lux. See the datasheet for more information about the wavelengths of the two sensors.

#### Constructors

#####<class><i>class</i> LTR329ALS01(pysense = None, sda = 'P22', scl = 'P21', gain = ALS_GAIN_1X, integration = ALS_INT_100, rate = ALS_RATE_500)</class>

Creates a `LTR329ALS01` object, that will return values for light in lux. Constructor must be passed a Pysense or I2C object to successfully construct.

#### Methods

#####<function>LTR329ALS01.light()</function>

Read the light levels of both `LTR329ALS01` sensors. Returns a **tuple** with two values for light levels in lux.

#### Arguments

The following arguments may be passed into the constructor.

**`gain`**

<constant>ALS_GAIN_1X</constant> <constant>ALS_GAIN_2X</constant> <constant>ALS_GAIN_4X</constant> <constant>ALS_GAIN_8X</constant> <constant>ALS_GAIN_48X</constant> <constant>ALS_GAIN_96X</constant>

<br/>
**`integration`**

<br/>
**`rate`**

<constant>ALS_RATE_50</constant> <constant>ALS_RATE_100</constant> <constant>ALS_RATE_200</constant> <constant>ALS_RATE_500</constant> <constant>ALS_RATE_1000</constant> <constant>ALS_RATE_2000</constant>

### Humidity and Temperature Sensor (SI7006A20)

Pysense has a Humidity and Temperature sensor that provides values of relative humidity and external temperature.

#### Constructors

#####<class><i>class</i> SI7006A20(pysense = None, sda = 'P22', scl = 'P21')</class>

Creates a `SI7006A20` object, that will return values for humidity (%) and temperature ('C). Constructor must be passed a Pysense or I2C object to successfully construct.

#### Methods
#####<function>SI7006A20.humidity()</function>

Read the relative humidity of the `SI7006A20`. Returns a **float** with the percentage relative humidity.

#####<function>SI7006A20.temperature()</function>

Read the external temperature of the `SI7006A20`. Returns a **float** with the temperature.

### Barometric Pressure Sensor with Altimeter (MPL3115A2)

Pysense has a Barometric Pressure sensor that provides readings for pressure, altitude as well as an additional temperature sensor.

#### Constructors

#####<class><i>class</i> MPL3115A2(pysense = None, sda = 'P22', scl = 'P21', mode = PRESSURE)</class>

Creates a `MPL3115A2` object, that will return values for pressure (Pa), altitude (m) and temperature ('C). Constructor must be passed a Pysense or I2C object to successfully construct.

#### Methods
#####<function>MPL3115A2.pressure()</function>

Read the atmospheric pressure of the `MPL3115A2`. Returns a **float** with the pressure in (Pa).

#####<function>MPL3115A2.altitude()</function>

Read the altitude of the `MPL3115A2`. Returns a **float** with the altitude in (m).

#####<function>MPL3115A2.temperature()</function>

Read the temperature of the `MPL3115A2`. Returns a **float** with the temperature in ('C).

#### Arguments

The following arguments may be passed into the constructor.

**`mode`**

<constant>PRESSURE</constant> <constant>ALTITUDE</constant>
