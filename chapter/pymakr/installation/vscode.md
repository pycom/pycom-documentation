Plugin. To download Visual Studio Code, navigate to

## Connecting via Serial USB

After installing the Pymakr Plugin, you need to take a few seconds to configure
it for first time use. Please follow these steps:

1. Connect your Pycom device to your computer via USB. If you are using an
expansion board, and have just finished a firmware upgrade, be sure to **Remove
the wire between GND and G23** and reset your device by pressing the button.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and ensure that the Pymakr Plugin has correctly installed.
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_1.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>
3. Click `All commands` on the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_2.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>
4. In the list that appears, click `Pymakr > Extra > List Serial Ports`
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_3.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>
5. This will list the available serial ports. If Pymakr is able to auto-detect
which to use, this will be copied to your clipboard. If not please manually copy
the correct serial port.
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_4.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>
6. Once again click `All commands`, then click `Pymakr > Global Settings`. This
will open a JSON file. Paste the serial address you copied earlier into the field
`address` and save the file.
 <p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_5.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>
7. Finally close the JSON file, click `All commands`, then `Pymakr > Connect` to
connect your device. The Pymakr console should show three arrows `>>>`,
indicating that you are connected
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/visual_studio_code/vsc_config_step_6.png" style="max-width:600px;"></p>

These settings can also be applied on a per project basis by clicking `All
commands` then `Pymakr > Project Settings`. This will open a JSON file which you
can edit to enter your desired settings for the currently open project.

{% hint style='info' %}
This process is easiest with either a Pycom Expansion Board or a Pytrack/Pysense
as the addresses are automatically selected. For external products such as FTDI
USB Serial Cables, the serial address may need to be copied manually.
Additionally, the reset button on the device may also need to be pressed before
a connection message appears.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting via Telnet

After installing the Pymakr Plugin, a device may be connected via the telnet
interface. Please see the following steps:

1. Ensure that Pycom device is turned on
2. Connect the host computer to the WiFi Access Point named after your board
(the SSID will be as follows e.g. `lopy-wlan-xxxx`, `wipy-wlan-xxxx`, etc.).
The password is `www.pycom.io`.
3. Follow the steps as above in the "Connecting via Serial USB" section but
enter `192.168.4.1` as the address.
4. The default username and password are `micro` and `python`,
respectively.
5. Finally close the JSON file, click `All commands`, then `Pymakr > Connect`,
Pymakr will now connect via telnet.
