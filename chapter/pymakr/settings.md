# Pymakr settings

Below you will find a description of the various settings available for Pymakr.

## address
This is the address of the Pycom module you want Pymakr can connect to. This
can be either a serial port (e.g `COM1` on windows or `/dev/cu.usbserial-DQ0054ES`
on Linux/macOS) or an IP address (Telnet) (e.g. `192.168.4.1` if connected
to the AP created by the Pycom module).

## username
If a IP address was provided for the `address` therefore Pymakr is connecting
via Telnet, you will also need to provide a username, the default is `micro`.

## password
If an IP address was provided for the address, Pymakr is connecting
via Telnet. You will also need to provide a password, the default is `python`.

## sync_folder
If left blank, all directories inside the project will be synced to the device
when the user clicks `upload`. If directories are specified, only these
directories will be synced, all others will be ignored

## open_on_start
If set to `true`, the Pymakr console will open and try to connect when the
editor is started, or a project is opened.

## safe_boot_on_upload
If set to `true`, Pymakr will reboot the connected device into safe-mode before
uploading. This is useful if your code uses a lot of RAM causing issues with the
upload procedure.

This feature is only available on modules running firmware version `1.17.0.b1`
or higher.

## sync_file_types
Only files ending with the extensions listed in this setting will be synced to
the device when performing an upload. All other files are ignored. By default
this is set to include: `py, txt, log, json, xml`

## ctrl_c_on_connect
If set to `true`, Pymakr will sent the `ctrl-c` signal to the connected module
before uploading. This should stop the script currently running on the device
and improve the reliability of the upload process.
