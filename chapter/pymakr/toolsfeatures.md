# Tools and Features

### Console (REPL)

MicroPython has an interactive code tool known as the REPL (Read Evaluate Print Line). The REPL allows you to run code on your device, line by line. To begin coding, go to the Pymakr Plugin Console and start typing your code. Start by making the LED change colour.

```python
import pycom # we need this module to control the LED

pycom.heartbeat(False) # disable the blue blinking
pycom.rgbled(0x00ff00) # make the LED light up green in colour
```

You can change the colour by adjusting the hex RGB value.

```python
pycom.rgbled(0xff0000) # now make the LED light up red in colour
```

The console can be used to run any python code, also functions or loops.

Use `print()` to output contents of variables to the console for you to read. Returned values from functions will also be displayed if they are not caught in a variable. This will not happen for code running from the main or boot files. Here you need to use `print()` to output to the console.

{% hint style='info' %}
Note that after writing or pasting any indented code like a function or a while loop, the user will have to press enter up to three times to tell MicroPython the code is to be closed (this is standard MicroPython & Python behaviour).

Also be aware that code written into the REPL is not saved after the device is powered off/on again.
{% endhint %}

### Run

To test code on a device, create a new `.py` file or open an existing one, type the desired code, save the file and then press the `Run` button. This will run the code directly onto the Pycom board and output the results of the script to the REPL.

{% hint style='info' %}
Changes made to files wonâ€™t be automatically uploaded to the board upon restarting or exiting the `Run` feature, as the Pycom board will not store this code. In order to push the code permanently to a device, use the `Upload` feature.
{% endhint %}

### Projects

Pymakr Plugin supports user projects, allowing for pre-configured settings such as default serial address/credentials, files to be ignored and folders to sync.

#### pymakr.conf

Pymakr Plugin supports local project settings using a file called `pymakr.conf`. This can be used to store the default serial address of a device, which files to ignore and other settings. An example `pymakr.conf` is shown below:

```json
{
    "address": "/dev/cu.usbserial-AB001234",
    "username": "micro",
    "password": "python",
    "sync_folder": "scripts"
}
```

### Upload

The Pymakr Plugins have a feature to sync and upload code to a device. This can be used for both uploading code to a device as well as testing out scripts by running them live on the device. The following steps demonstrate how to use this feature.

To start using the `Upload` feature, ensure that a project folder has been created for the device. For example, if using the `pymakr.conf` from above, this project folder should be named `scripts`. This folder should have the following structure:

<p align="center"><img src ="../../img/mp-filestructure.png" width="250"></p>

Library files should be placed into the `lib` folder, certificates into the `cert` folder and so on. The `Upload` button will take the highest level folder (currently open) and upload this to the connected Pycom device. The files will be pushed to the device in exactly the same structure as within the code editor's file directory.

### More

Clicking the `More` button within the Pymakr Plugin allows for some additional features. See the options below for specific functionality.

##### Get Firmware Version

Retrieves the firmware version of the Pycom device connected to the Pymakr Plugin instance.

##### Get WiFi AP SSID

Retrieves the default WiFi Access Point SSID of the Pycom device connected to the Pymakr Plugin instance.

##### Get Serial Ports

Retrieves the various serial ports that are available to the Pymakr Plugin instance.
