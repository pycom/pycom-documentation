# How to get the IMEI of your module

In order to retrieve the IMEI of your cellular enabled Pycom module you will
firstly need to make sure you are on firmware version `1.17.0.b1` or higher. You
can check your firmware version by running the following code on you device via
the interactive REPL.

```python
>>> import os
>>> os.uname()
(sysname='GPy', nodename='GPy', release='1.17.0.b1', version='v1.8.6-849-d0dc708 on 2018-02-27', machine='GPy with ESP32')
```

Once you have a compatible firmware, you can run the following code to get your
modules IMEI number:

```python
from network import LTE
lte = LTE()
lte.send_at_cmd('AT+CGSN=1')
```

Youâ€™ll get a return string like this `\r\n+CGSN: "354347xxxxxxxxx"\r\n\r\nOK`.
The value between the double quotes is your IMEI.
