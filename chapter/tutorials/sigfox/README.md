# SiPy Tutorials

To ensure your device has been provisioned with **Device ID** and **PAC number**, please update to the latest firmware.

The following tutorials demonstrate how to register and get started with the SiPy. The SiPy can be configured for operation in various countries based upon specified RCZ zones (see the `Sigfox` class for more info). The SiPy supports both uplink and downlink `Sigfox` messages as well as device to device communication via its FSK Mode `Sigfox`.
