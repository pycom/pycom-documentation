# Threading

MicroPython supports spawning threads by the `_thread` module. The following example demonstrates the use of this module. A thread is simply defined as a function that can receive any number of parameters. Below 3 threads are started, each one perform a print at a different interval.

```python
import _thread
import time

def th_func(delay, id):
    while True:
        time.sleep(delay)
        print('Running thread %d' % id)

for i in range(3):
    _thread.start_new_thread(th_func, (i + 1, i))
```

### Using Locks:

```python
import _thread

a_lock = _thread.allocate_lock()

with a_lock:
    print("a_lock is locked while this executes")
```
