# class WDT â€“ Watchdog Timer

The WDT is used to restart the system when the application crashes and ends up into a non recoverable state. After enabling, the application must "feed" the watchdog periodically to prevent it from expiring and resetting the system.

### Quick Usage Example

```python
from machine import WDT
wdt = WDT(timeout=2000)  # enable it with a timeout of 2 seconds
wdt.feed()
```

### Constructors

#####<class><i>class</i> machine.WDT(id=0, timeout)</class>

Create a WDT object and start it. The `id` can only be `0`. See the init method for the parameters of initialisation.

### Methods

#####<function>wdt.init(timeout)</function>

Initialises the watchdog timer. The timeout must be given in milliseconds. Once it is running the WDT cannot be stopped but the timeout can be re-configured at any point in time.

#####<function>wdt.feed()</function>

Feed the WDT to prevent it from resetting the system. The application should place this call in a sensible place ensuring that the WDT is only fed after verifying that everything is functioning correctly.
