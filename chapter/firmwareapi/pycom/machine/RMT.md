# class RMT â€“ Remote Controller

The RMT (Remote Control) module is primarily designed to send and receive infrared remote control signals that
use on-off-keying of a carrier frequency, but due to its design it can be used to generate various types of signals.

### Quick Usage Example: sending

```python
import machine

# create a RMT object for transmission
rmt = machine.RMT(channel=3, gpio="P20", tx_idle_level=0)
# create series of bits to send    
data = (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)
# define duration of the bits, time unit depends on the selected RMT channel  
duration = 10000
# send the signal                                         
rmt.send_pulses(duration, data)
```

### Quick Usage Example: receiving

```python
import machine
# create a RMT object
rmt = machine.RMT(channel=3)
# Configure RTM for receiving
rmt.init(gpio="P20", rx_idle_threshold=12000)     
# wait for any number of pulses until one longer than rx_idle_threshold        
data = rmt.recv_pulses()
```

### Constructors
<class><i>class</i> machine.RMT(channel,...)</class>

Construct an RMT object on the given channel. `channel` can be 2-7. With no additional parameters, the RMT object is created but not initialised. If extra arguments are given, the RMT is initialised for transmission or reception. See `init` for parameters of initialisation.
The resolution which a pulse can be sent/received depends on the selected channel:

| Channel | Resolution | Maximum Pulse Width |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 0 <td colspan=3> Used by on-board LED
| 1 <td colspan=3> Used by `pycom.pulses_get()`
|    2    |    100nS   |      3.2768 ms      |
|    3    |    100nS   |      3.2768 ms      |
|    4    |   1000nS   |      32.768 ms      |
|    5    |   1000nS   |      32.768 ms      |
|    6    |   3125nS   |     102.4   ms      |
|    7    |   3125nS   |     102.4   ms      |

### Methods

<function>rmt.init(gpio, rx_idle_threshold, rx_filter_threshold, tx_idle_level, tx_carrier)</function>

Initialise the RMT peripheral with the given parameters:

- `gpio` is the GPIO Pin to use.
- `rx_idle_threshold` is the maximum duration of a valid pulse. The represented time unit (resolution) depends on the selected channel, value can be 0-65535.
- `rx_filter_threshold` is the minimum duration of a valid pulse. The represented time unit (resolution) depends on the selected channel, value can be 0-31.
- `tx_idle_level` is the output signal's level after the transmission is finished, can be <constant>RMT.HIGH</constant> or <constant>RMT.LOW</constant>.
- `tx_carrier` is the modulation of the pulses to send.

Either `rx_idle_threshold` or `tx_idle_level` must be defined, both cannot be given at the same time because a channel can be configured in RX or TX mode only.
`rx_filter_threshold` is not mandatory parameter. If not given then all pulses are accepted with duration less than `rx_idle_threshold`.
`tx_carrier` is not mandatory parameters. If not given no modulation is used on the sent pulses.

The `tx_carrier` parameter is a tuple with the following structure:
- `carrier_freq_hz` is the carrier's frequency in Hz.
- `carrier_duty_percent` is the duty percent of the carrier's signal, can be 0%-100%.
- `carrier_level` is the level of the pulse to modulate, can be <constant>RMT.HIGH</constant> or <constant>RMT.LOW</constant>.

<function>rmt.deinit()</function>

Deinitialise the RMT object.

{% hint style='info' %}
If an RMT object needs to be reconfigured from RX/TX to TX/RX, then either first `deinit()` must be called or the `init()` again with the desired configuration.
{% endhint %}

<function>rmt.pulses_get(pulses, timeout)</function>

Reads in pulses from the GPIO pin.
 - `pulses` if not specified, this function will keep reading pulses until the
 `rx_idle_threshold` is exceeded. If it is specified this function will return
 the exactly that number of pulses, ignoring anything shorter than
 `rx_filter_threshold` or longer than `rx_idle_threshold`.
 - `timeout` is specified, this function will return if the first pulse does
 not occur within `timeout` microseconds. If not specified, it will wait
 indefinitely.

Return value: Tuple of items with the following structure:
(level, duration):
- `level` represents the level of the received bit/pulse, can be 0 or 1.
- `duration` represents the duration of the received pulse, the time unit (resolution) depends on the selected channel.

{% hint style='info' %}
Maximum of 128 pulses can be received in a row without receiving "idle" signal. If the incoming pulse sequence contains more than 128 pulses the rest is dropped and the receiver waits for another sequence of pulses.
The `pulses_get` function can be called to receive more than 128 pulses, however the above mentioned limitation should be kept in mind when evaluating the received data.
{% endhint %}

<function>rmt.pulses_send(duration, data, start_level)</function>

Generates pulses as defined by the parameters below
- `duration` represents the duration of the pulses to be sent,
 the time unit (resolution) depends on the selected channel.
- `data` Tuple that represents the sequence of pulses to be sent, must be
composed of 0 or 1 elements.
- `start_level` defines the state (HIGH/LOW) of the first pulse given by
`duration` if `data` is not given.

`data` must be a tuple and `duration` can be a tuple or a single number, with
`data` being optional. In the case that only `duration` is provided, it must
be a tuple and you must also provide `start_level` which will dictate the
level of the first duration, the signal level then toggles between each duration value. If `data` is provided and `duration` is a single number, each pulse
in `data` will have have an equal length as set by `duration`. If `data`
and `duration` are provided as tuples, they must be of the same number of
elements, with each pulse lasting its matching duration.


### Constants
<constant>RMT.LOW</constant> <constant>RMT.HIGH</constant>

Defines the level of the pulse.
