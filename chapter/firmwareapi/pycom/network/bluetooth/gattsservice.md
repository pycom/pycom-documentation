# class GATTSService
The GATT Server allows the device to act as a peripheral and hold its own ATT lookup data, server & characteristic definitions. In this mode, the device acts as a slave and a master must initiate a request.

Services are used to categorise data up into specific chunks of data known as characteristics. A service may have multiple characteristics, and each service has a unique numeric ID called a UUID.

The following class allows control over Server services.

#####<function>service.start()</function>

Starts the service if not already started.

#####<function>service.stop()</function>

Stops the service if previously started.

#####<function>service.characteristic(uuid, * , permissions, properties, value)</function>

Creates a new characteristic on the service. Returns an object of the class GATTSCharacteristic. The arguments are:

- `uuid` is the UUID of the service. Can take an integer or a 16 byte long string or bytes object.
- `permissions` configures the permissions of the characteristic. Takes an integer with a combination of the flags.
- `properties` sets the properties. Takes an integer with an OR-ed combination of the flags.
- `value` sets the initial value. Can take an integer, a string or a bytes object.

```python
service.characteristic('temp', value=25)
```
