# Serial USB REPL (UART)

To use the REPL, a Pycom device must be connected to the host computer with a
USB connection either to an Expansion Board or to serial converter (a diagram of
how to do this can be found the the [getting started](../../README.md) page for
your module).

In order to connect to the REPL over USB serial, there are multiple methods.
Detailed below are the explanations of how to do it in MacOS, Linux and Windows.

### All platforms
By far the easiest way to access the USB UART REPL is via the our [Pymakr plug-in](/chapter/pymakr/installation/README.md)
for Atom and Visual Studio Code. This adds a pane to the bottom of the editors
that allows you to directly access the REPL and any output from the device.
Detailed instructions on how to setup Pymakr can be found
[here](/chapter/pymakr/installation/README.md).

### macOS and Linux

To open a serial USB connection from macOS, any serial tool may be used; in this
example, the terminal tool `screen` will be used.

Open a terminal instance and run the following commands:

```bash
$ screen /dev/tty.usbmodem* 115200
```

Upon exiting `screen`, press `CTRL-A CTRL-\`. If the keyboard does not support
the `\`-key (i.e. an obscure combination for `\` like `ALT-SHIFT-7` is required),
the key combination can be remapped for the `quit` command:

- create `~/.screenrc`
- add bind `q` to the `exit` command

This will allow screen to exited by pressing `CTRL-A Q`.

{% hint style='info' %}
On Linux, `picocom` or `minicom` may be used instead of `screen`. The usb
serial address might also be listed as `/dev/ttyUSB01` or a higher increment for
`ttyUSB`. Additionally, the elevated permissions to access the device (e.g. group
uucp/dialout or use `sudo`) may be required.
{% endhint %}


### Windows

A terminal emulator is needed to open the connection from Windows; the easiest
option is to download the free program,
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

##### COM Port

To use PuTTY the serial port (COM port) in which the Pycom device is connected,
must be located. In Windows, this information can be found from the
'Device Manager' program.

1. Open the Windows start menu and search for 'Device Manager'
2. The COM port for the Pycom device will be listed as 'USB Serial Device' or a
similar name
3. Copy/Write down the associated COM port (e.g. `COM4`)

##### Using Putty

1. With PuTTY open, click on `Session` in the left-hand panel
2. Next click the `Serial` radio button on the right and enter the associated
COM port (e.g. `COM4`) in the `Serial Line` box
3. Finally, click the `Open` button
