## LoRaWAN Registration

### Raw LoRa
When using raw LoRa, you do not have to register your module in any way. The
modules can talk to each other directly.

### LoRaWAN
In order to connect your LoRa capable Pycom module to a LoRaWAN network you will
have to register your device with the desired network. We are unable to provide
instructions for all LoRaWAN networks but below you will find some generic
instructions, along with links to any specific guides we are aware of.

#### Generic instructions

Firstly you will need to get your modules `Device EUI`, this can be achieved
using the following code:

```python
from network import LoRa
import ubinascii

lora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORAWAN)
print(ubinascii.hexlify(lora.mac()).upper().decode('utf-8'))
```

The output will be a hex string like: `70B3D5499585FCA1`. Once you have this
you will need to provide it to your LoRaWAN network which will then provide you
with the details need to connect via Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or
Activation by Personalisation (ABP)

##### OTAA
If you wish to connect via OTAA (which is the recommended method) the network
will provide you with an `Application EUI` and `Application Key`. The former
identifies what application your device is connecting to, the latter is a shared
secret key unique to your device to generate the session keys that prove its
identity to the network. Once you have these you can use the
[LoRaWAN OTAA example](/chapter/tutorials/lora/lorawan-otaa.md) code to connect to
the network.

##### ABP
With ABP the encryption keys enabling communication with the network are
preconfigured in the device. The network will need to provide you with a
`Device Address`, `Network Session Key` and `Application Session Key`. Once you
have these you can use the
[LoRaWAN ABP example](/chapter/tutorials/lora/lorawan-abp.md) code to connect to
the network.

If you cannot find your favourite LoRaWAN network in the list above, please
consider writing a tutorial for how to connect a Pycom module with it and
contribute it to this documentation via a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-documentation).
