## Cellular registration

In order to use your GPy/FiPy on a cellular network you are required to get a
SIM card from a local provider. *Note:* This might differ from a standard SIM
you can buy in a store, our devices do not support standard LTE.

Currently we are not able to provide any specific details about how to get such
a SIM card and how to register it as most deployments are closed trials, each
carrier has itâ€™s own rules (for example, whether they require special SIMs or not).

We recommend contacting your local cellular providers to check their plans
surrounding LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT. By contacting them, you will show the carriers
that there is local interest in deploying such networks.

You can find a map of deployed networks and open labs [here](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map/#deployments).
