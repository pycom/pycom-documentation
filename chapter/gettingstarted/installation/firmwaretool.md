### Updating Device Firmware

The instructions given by the updater tool should be followed carefully. The basic procedure can be found below:

{% hint style='info' %}
If you are having trouble connecting via USB, make sure you have the correct [FTDI drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) installed.
{% endhint %}

1. Disconnect your device from your computer
2. Connect a jumper cable or wire between G23 and GND
3. Reconnect the board via USB to your computer, then press the button, this puts the device in ‘firmware update mode’.
4. Run the Firmware Upgrade tool
5. Remove the G23 to GND jumper cable/wire
6. Reboot the device (button or power off then on)

After you’re done with upgrading, you can use the Pymakr Plugins to upload and run programs in your device.

{% hint style='danger' %}
Make sure the **TX jumper** is present on your expansion board, as the jumpers sometimes come loose in the box during transport. Without this jumper, the updater will fail.
