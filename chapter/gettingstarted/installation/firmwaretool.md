### Updating Device Firmware

The basic firmware upgrade procedure can be found below, please follow these
steps carefully:

{% tabs first="Expansion Board 2.0", second="Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan/Expansion Board 3.0" %}

{% content "first" %}

1. Disconnect your device from your computer
2. Insert module into the Expansion Board
3. Connect a jumper cable or wire between `G23` and `GND`
4. Reconnect the board via USB to your computer, this puts the device in ‘firmware update mode’.
5. Run the Firmware Upgrade tool
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/firmware-update.png" width="500"></p>
6. Remove the `G23` to `GND` jumper cable/wire
7. Reboot the device (button or power off then on), your device is now ready to
   use

If you are having any issues, make sure the **TX and RX jumpers** are present on
your Expansion Board, as the jumpers sometimes come loose in the box during
transport. Without these jumpers, the updater will fail.

{% content "second" %}

When using a Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan/Expansion Board 3.0 to update your module
you are not required to make a connection between `G23` and `GND`, the
Pysense/Pytrack/Pyscan/Expansion Board 3.0 will do this automatically.

1. Before connecting your module to a Pysense/Pytrack
   board, you should update the firmware on the
   Pysense/Pytrack. Instructions on how to do this
   can be found [here](../../pytrackpysense/installation/firmware.md).
2. Disconnect your device from your computer
3. Insert module into Expansion Board
4. Reconnect the board via USB to your computer
5. Run the Firmware Upgrade tool
<p align="center"><img src ="../../../img/firmware-update.png" width="500"></p>
6. Disconnect the USB cable from the board and reconnect it, your device is now
   ready to use

{% endtabs %}

After you’re done with upgrading, you can use the Pymakr Plugins to upload and run programs in your device.
