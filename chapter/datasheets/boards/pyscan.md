### Pyscan Libraries
- Pyscan libraries to use the RFID/NFC reader are located here: https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/tree/master/pyscan
- The accelerometer library is here: https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pytrack/lib/LIS2HH12.py

For the time being, we recommend to upload the `MFRC630.mpy` file via FTP due to current limitations of Pymakr that will be fixed shortly.

Libraries for the rest of the components will be added soon.
