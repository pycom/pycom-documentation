# Firmware Downgrade

The firmware upgrade tool usually updates your device to the latest available
firmware version. If you require to downgrade your device to a previous firmware
there are two methods to achieve this.

{% hint style='info' %}
If you are using an Expansion Board 1.0 or 2.0, you will need to have a jumper
connected between `G23` and `GND` to use either procedure below. You will also
need to press the reset button before beginning.
{% endhint %}

You can obtain previous firmware versions here:
 - [WiPy](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/WiPy.html)
 - [LoPy](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/LoPy.html)
 - [SiPy](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/SiPy.html)
 - [GPy](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/GPy.html)
 - [FiPy](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/FiPy.html)
 - [LoPy4](https://software.pycom.io/downloads/LoPy4.html)

**Note:** Prior to version `1.16.0.b1` the firmware for modules with LoRa
functionality was frequency specific. From `1.16.0.b1` and onward, the firmware
is region agnostic and this can either be set programatically or via the config
block (see [here](./cli.md#lpwan)).

## GUI

As of version `1.12.0.b0` of the firmware update tool, you can now provide a
`.tar` or `.tar.gz` archive of the firmware you wish to upload to the board.

When you start the update tool you will see the following screen:

When you tick the `Flash from local file` option, an address bar will appear.
Click the `...` button and locate the `.tar(.gz)` file with the firmware you wish
to flash to your device. From this point the updater will behave just like a
regular update but using the local file instead of downloading the latest.

## Command line

You can also use the [CLI](./cli.md) version of the update tool to downgrade
your device. Will need to get a `.tar` or `.tar.gz` archive of the firmware you
wish to upload to the board. Then run the following commands:

```bash
$ pycom-fwtool-cli -v -p PORT flash -t /path/to/firmware/archive.tar.gz
```
