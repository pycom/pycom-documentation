Select how you would like to connect your device to Pybytes:

1. [Connect your device quickly \(Recommended\)](quick.md)

{% page-ref page="quick.md" %}

2. [Connect your device by flashing Pybytes Library](flash.md)

{% page-ref page="flash.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
From firmware 1.16.x onwards all Pycom devices come with Pybytes library built-in `/frozen` folder. That means that you can choose between adding your device quickly with the firmware updater or you can flash Pybytes library manually.
