# WLAN

This class provides a driver for the WiFi network processor in the module. Example usage:

```python
import network
import time
# setup as a station
wlan = network.WLAN(mode=network.WLAN.STA)
wlan.connect('your-ssid', auth=(network.WLAN.WPA2, 'your-key'))
while not wlan.isconnected():
    time.sleep_ms(50)
print(wlan.ifconfig())

# now use socket as usual
```

## Quick Usage Example

```python
import machine
from network import WLAN

# configure the WLAN subsystem in station mode (the default is AP)
wlan = WLAN(mode=WLAN.STA)
# go for fixed IP settings (IP, Subnet, Gateway, DNS)
wlan.ifconfig(config=('192.168.0.107', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.1', '192.168.0.1'))
wlan.scan()     # scan for available networks
wlan.connect(ssid='mynetwork', auth=(WLAN.WPA2, 'my_network_key'))
while not wlan.isconnected():
    pass
print(wlan.ifconfig())
```

## Constructors

### class network.WLAN\(id=0, ...\)

Create a WLAN object, and optionally configure it. See [`init`](wlan.md#wlan-init-mode-ssid-none-auth-none-channel-1-antenna-none-power_save-false-hidden-false) for params of configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
The WLAN constructor is special in the sense that if no arguments besides the `id` are given, it will return the already existing WLAN instance without re-configuring it. This is because WLAN is a system feature of the WiPy. If the already existing instance is not initialised it will do the same as the other constructors an will initialise it with default values.
{% endhint %}

## Methods

#### wlan.init\(mode, \* , ssid=None, auth=None, channel=1, antenna=None, power\_save=False, hidden=False, bandwidth=HT40, max\_tx\_pwr=20, country=CN\)

Set or get the WiFi network processor configuration.

Arguments are:

* `mode` can be either `WLAN.STA`, `WLAN.AP`, or `WLAN.STA_AP`.
* `ssid` is a string with the SSID name. Only needed when mode is `WLAN.AP`.
* `auth` is a tuple with \(sec, key\). Security can be `None`, `WLAN.WEP`, `WLAN.WPA`, or `WLAN.WPA2`. The key is a string with the network password.
  * If `sec` is `WLAN.WEP` the key must be a string representing hexadecimal values \(e.g. `ABC1DE45BF`\). Only needed when mode is `WLAN.AP`.
* `channel` a number in the range 1-11. Only needed when mode is `WLAN.AP`.
* `antenna` selects between the internal and the external antenna. Can be either `WLAN.INT_ANT`, `WLAN.EXT_ANT`. With our development boards it defaults to using the internal antenna, but in the case of an OEM module, the antenna pin \(`P12`\) is not used, so it’s free to be

  used for other things.

* `power_save` enables or disables power save functions in `STA` mode.
* `hidden` only valid in `WLAN.AP` mode to create an access point with a hidden SSID when set to `True`.
* `bandwidth` is the Bandwidth to use, either 20MHz or 40 MHz , use `HT20` or `HT40`
* `max_tx_pwr` is the maximum WiFi Tx power allowed. see `WLAN.max_tx_power()` for more details
* `country` tuple representing the country configuration parameters. see `WLAN.country()` for more details

For example, you can do:

```python
# create and configure as an access point
wlan.init(mode=WLAN.AP, ssid='wipy-wlan', auth=(WLAN.WPA2,'www.wipy.io'), channel=7, antenna=WLAN.INT_ANT)
```

or

```python
# configure as an station
wlan.init(mode=WLAN.STA)
```

### wlan.deinit\(\)

Disables the WiFi radio.

### wlan.connect\(ssid, \* , auth=None, bssid=None, timeout=None, ca\_certs=None, keyfile=None, certfile=None, identity=None, hostname=None\)

Connect to a wifi access point using the given SSID, and other security parameters.

* `auth` is a tuple with `(sec, key)`. Security can be `None`, `WLAN.WEP`, `WLAN.WPA`, `WLAN.WPA2` or `WLAN.WPA2_ENT`. The key is a string with the network password.
  * If `sec` is `WLAN.WEP` the key must be a string representing hexadecimal values \(e.g. `ABC1DE45BF`\).
  * If `sec` is `WLAN.WPA2_ENT` then the `auth` tuple can have either 3 elements: `(sec, username, password)`, or just 1: `(sec,)`. When passing the 3 element tuple, the`keyfile` and `certifle` arguments must not be given.
* `bssid` is the MAC address of the AP to connect to. Useful when there are several APs with the same SSID.
* `timeout` is the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to succeed.
* `ca_certs` is the path to the CA certificate. This argument is not mandatory.
* `keyfile` is the path to the client key. Only used if `username` and `password` are not part of the `auth` tuple.
* `certfile` is the path to the client certificate. Only used if `username` and `password` are not part of the `auth` tuple.
* `identity` is only used in case of `WLAN.WPA2_ENT` security. Needed by the server.
* `hostname` is the name of the host connecting to the AP. Max length of name string is 32 Bytes

{% hint style="info" %}
The ESP32 only handles certificates with `pkcs8` format \(but not the "Traditional SSLeay RSAPrivateKey" format\). The private key should be RSA coded with 2048 bits at maximum.
{% endhint %}

#### wlan.scan\(\[ssid=NULL, bssid=NULL, channel=0, show\_hidden=False, type=WLAN.SCAN\_ACTIVE, scantime=120ms\]\)

Performs a network scan and returns a list of named tuples with \(ssid, bssid, sec, channel, rssi\). When no config args passed scan will be performed with default configurations.

Note: For Fast scan mode ssid/bssid and channel should be

* `ssid` : If the SSID is not NULL, it is only the AP with the same SSID that can be scanned.
* `bssid` : If the BSSID is not NULL, it is only the AP with the same BSSID that can be scanned. The bssid is given as 6 Hexadecimal bytes literals \(i.e b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'\)
* `channel` : If “channel” is 0, there will be an all-channel scan; otherwise, there will be a specific-channel scan.
* `show_hidden` : If “show\_hidden” is 0, the scan ignores the AP with a hidden SSID; otherwise, the scan considers the hidden AP a normal one.
* `type` : If “type” is `WLAN.SCAN_ACTIVE`, the scan is “active”; otherwise, it is a “passive” one.
  * Active Scan is performed by sending a probe request. The default scan is an active scan
  * Passive Scan sends no probe request. Just switch to the specific channel and wait for a beacon.
* `scantime` :

  This field is used to control how long the scan dwells on each channel. For passive scans, scantime=\[int\] designates the dwell time for each channel.

  For active scans, dwell times for each channel are listed below. scantime is given as a tuple for min and max times \(min,max\)

min=0, max=0: scan dwells on each channel for 120 ms.

min&gt;0, max=0: scan dwells on each channel for 120 ms.

min=0, max&gt;0: scan dwells on each channel for max ms.

min&gt;0, max&gt;0: The minimum time the scan dwells on each channel is min ms. If no AP is found during this time frame, the scan switches to the next channel. Otherwise, the scan dwells on the channel for max ms.If you want to improve the performance of the the scan, you can try to modify these two parameters.

### wlan.disconnect\(\)

Disconnect from the WiFi access point.

### wlan.isconnected\(\)

In case of STA mode, returns `True` if connected to a WiFi access point and has a valid IP address. In AP mode returns `True` when a station is connected, `False` otherwise.

### wlan.ifconfig\(id=0, config=\['dhcp' or configtuple\]\)

When `id` is 0, the configuration will be get/set on the Station interface. When `id` is 1 the configuration will be done for the AP interface.

With no parameters given returns a 4-tuple of `(ip, subnet_mask, gateway, DNS_server)`.

If `dhcp` is passed as a parameter then the DHCP client is enabled and the IP params are negotiated with the AP.

If the 4-tuple config is given then a static IP is configured. For instance:

```python
wlan.ifconfig(config=('192.168.0.4', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.1', '8.8.8.8'))
```

### wlan.mode\(\[mode\]\)

Get or set the WLAN mode.

### wlan.ssid\(\[ssid\]\)

In case of mode = `WLAN.AP` this method can get the ssid of the board's own AP.

In case of mode = `WLAN.STA_AP` this method can get the ssid of board's own AP plus the AP the STA is connected to in form of a tuple:
