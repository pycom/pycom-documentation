# 4.4 Sigfox Examples

Before you start, make sure that your device was registered with [Sigfox](../../1.-getting-started/registration/sigfox.md).

The following tutorials demonstrate how to register and get started with the SiPy. The SiPy can be configured for operation in various countries based upon specified RCZ zones \(see the `Sigfox` class for more info\). The SiPy supports both uplink and downlink `Sigfox` messages as well as device to device communication via its FSK Mode `Sigfox`.
