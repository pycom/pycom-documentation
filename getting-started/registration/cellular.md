# Cellular

In order to use your GPy/FiPy on a cellular network you are required to get a SIM card from a local provider.

_Note: This might differ from a standard SIM you can buy in a store, our devices do not support standard LTE._

Currently we are not able to provide any specific details about how to get such a SIM card and how to register it as most deployments are closed trials, each carrier has it’s own rules \(for example, whether they require special SIMs or not\).

We recommend contacting your local cellular providers to check their plans surrounding LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT. By contacting them, you will show the carriers that there is local interest in deploying such networks.

You can find a map of deployed networks and open labs [here](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map/#deployments).
